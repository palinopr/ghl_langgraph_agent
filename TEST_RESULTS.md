# Battery Consultation Agent - Test Results

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Local Agent Testing
- The agent responds correctly in Spanish
- Battery consultation flow is working
- Tools are imported successfully
- All environment variables are set

**Test Command**: `python3 test_agent_direct.py`

### 2. Agent Responses
- Test 1: "Hola, necesito información sobre baterías" 
  → Agent responds asking about house/apartment
- Test 2: "Vivo en un apartamento"
  → Agent asks about equipment needs
- Test 3: Shows the agent starts fresh each time (no state persistence in direct test)

## ❌ What's Not Working

### 1. Webhook Integration in Deployment
- Webhook receives messages but agent doesn't process them
- No traces appearing in LangSmith
- The custom_app.py needs proper integration with LangGraph deployment

### 2. Local Testing Issues
- Ports 8000, 8001 are already in use
- Need to use port 8002 for local testing
- Python 3.9 compatibility issues (fixed by changing type annotations)

## 🔧 How to Test Locally

1. **Test Agent Directly** (Working ✅)
   ```bash
   python3 test_setup.py  # Check setup
   python3 test_agent_direct.py  # Test agent
   ```

2. **Test Webhook Server** (To be tested)
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Start server
   python3 run_local.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - Test webhook
   python3 test_webhook_local.py
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment Issues

The main issue is that in LangGraph Cloud deployment, the webhook is receiving messages but not invoking the agent properly. The custom_app.py is using the LangGraph SDK client, but it needs to be configured correctly for the deployment environment.

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Test the webhook locally with the updated ports
2. Verify the LangGraph SDK client initialization works
3. Check if the assistant_id "ghl_agent" matches what's in langgraph.json
4. Deploy and test with proper logging to see what's happening
