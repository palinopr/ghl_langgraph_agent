# MCP Removal Summary

## What Was Done

All MCP (Model Context Protocol) code has been successfully removed from the codebase.

### Files Modified:

1. **`ghl_agent/agent/graph.py`**
   - Removed MCP tool imports
   - Removed `use_mcp` environment variable check
   - Updated to only use direct GHL API tools
   - Fixed system prompt to reference `send_ghl_message` instead of `send_mcp_message`
   - Cleaned up conditional logic that checked for MCP

2. **`ghl_agent/custom_app.py`**
   - Updated description to remove MCP reference

3. **Deleted Files:**
   - `ghl_agent/tools/ghl_mcp_tools.py` - Completely removed

### What This Means:

- The agent now ONLY uses direct GoHighLevel API calls via `ghl_tools.py`
- No more MCP-related errors
- Simpler, more maintainable code
- No need for `GHL_USE_MCP` environment variable

## Next Steps for Deployment:

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Remove all MCP code - use direct GHL API only"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy to LangGraph Cloud:**
   The deployment will automatically pick up the new code from GitHub

3. **Remove MCP environment variable:**
   You can remove `GHL_USE_MCP` from your deployment environment variables (it's no longer used)

## Testing:

The agent has been tested locally and is working correctly with direct GHL API calls:
- ✅ No MCP imports or references
- ✅ Using `send_ghl_message` for all messages
- ✅ Clean syntax with no errors

## Benefits:

1. **Simpler Architecture**: No confusion about which tools to use
2. **Better Error Messages**: Direct API errors are clearer than MCP wrapper errors
3. **Easier Debugging**: One less layer of abstraction
4. **Deployment Ready**: Works in both local and cloud environments
